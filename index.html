         <h2>About me</h2>
         <p>Hi, My name is David, but i prefer Kobby (like the basketball player!) Although orignally born in Toronto,
             I've lived down in Seattle for pretty much my whole life. My hobbies include video games, music, and a little bit of cooking! 
             Growing up, i've always been infactuated by technology, and how it's constantly evolving everyday. I'm always eager to learn something
             new, which is why i've taken up learning to become a full-stack developer! Below here, you can see a small collection of projects i've worked
             on while on my journey to becoming a certified developer.
             </p>
